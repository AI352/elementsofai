# Project Title

due diligence assistant for mergers & acqusitions

## Summary

When a company is sold the seller sets up a so called dataroom. This includes thousands of documents which describes the financial and operational status of the company.
During the due diligence the buyer verifies the documents and checks for risks, i.e. obligations which the company may have to meet in the future.
AI could search the documents for risks which the due diligence shall verify. For example if you buy a company which produces cell phones, the due diligence will look for potential infringements of patents.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Due Diligence is a tedious work. It is always about looking for risks. But in each transaction potential risks differ. Documents must be reviews with a special focus on particular categories or types of risks.
* documents are of different formats (pdf, doc, xls, etc.) but all need to be reviewed.
* documents may be of different languages, but the reviewer does not understand all of them
* documents use very specific vocabulary which the reviewer is not familiar with


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The user shall describe in words the risk she/he is looking for or which may typically occur in the envisaged business.
The tool shall review all documents in the data room for potential descriptions of such risks. The marked documents than need detailed (human) review.


## Data sources and AI methods

Data is of PDF, word, xls format, or similar


## Challenges

different reviewers may formulate risks differently and/or use different wording than the persons who have produced the documents in the data room.

## What next?
